//Interface

/*Another way to achieve abstraction in C#, is with interfaces.
An interface is a completely "abstract class", which can only contain abstract methods and properties (with empty bodies)
By default, members of an interface are abstract and public.*/

using System;

namespace MyApplication
{
    // Interface
    interface IAnimal 
    {
        void animalSound(); // interface method (does not have a body)
    }

    // Pig "implements" the IAnimal interface
    class Pig : IAnimal 
    {
        public void animalSound() 
        {
            // The body of animalSound() is provided here
            Console.WriteLine("The pig says: wee wee");
        }
    }

    class Program 
    {
        static void Main(string[] args) 
        {
            Pig myPig = new Pig();  // Create a Pig object
            
            myPig.animalSound();
            Console.Write($"{Environment.NewLine}Press any key to exit...");
            Console.ReadKey(true);
        }
    }
}

/*Notes on Interfaces:
    Like abstract classes, interfaces cannot be used to create objects (in the example above, it is not possible to create an "IAnimal" object in the Program class)
    Interface methods do not have a body - the body is provided by the "implement" class
    On implementation of an interface, you must override all of its methods
    Interfaces can contain properties and methods, but not fields/variables
    Interface members are by default abstract and public
    An interface cannot contain a constructor (as it cannot be used to create objects)

Why And When To Use Interfaces?
1) To achieve security - hide certain details and only show the important details of an object (interface).
2) C# does not support "multiple inheritance" (a class can only inherit from one base class). 
However, it can be achieved with interfaces, because the class can implement multiple interfaces. 
Note: To implement multiple interfaces, separate them with a comma.*/
